I go on too many dates [chuckle] But I can't make them stay.
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm That's what people say, mmm-mmm.

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there 
On a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said,

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So, close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you, "Please don't go!"
And I said,

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.

Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh.

But I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said,

"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,

"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping.
Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain.
Still remains Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light.
That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw.
Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking.
People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share.
No one dared Disturb the sound of silence "Fools" said I, "You do not know.
Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you.
Take my arms that I might reach you" But my words like silent raindrops fell.
And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed.
To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning.
In the words that it was forming And the sign said, "The words of the prophets.
Are written on the subway walls And tenement halls" And whispered in the sounds of silence.
