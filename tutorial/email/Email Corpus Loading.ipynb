(NASDAQ: INTU\\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\\n> the board.\\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric\\'s overall profits and is among\\n> the world\\'s largest non-banking financial institutions.\\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit\\'s\\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I\\'m excited to have the\\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\\n> Intuit\\'s industry leadership to new heights.\"\\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company\\'s efforts to\\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital\\'s worldwide portfolio of\\n> businesses.\\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\\n> Capital\\'s more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett\\'s broad\\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses.
